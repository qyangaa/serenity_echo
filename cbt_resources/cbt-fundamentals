# Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Fundamentals

## Overview

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most extensively researched and evidence-based forms of psychotherapy. Developed by Dr. Aaron Beck in the 1960s, CBT is founded on the principle that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and by changing our thought patterns, we can positively influence our emotions and actions.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Cognitive Triangle

- **Thoughts** → **Feelings** → **Behaviors**
- These three elements continuously influence each other
- Changing one element can create positive changes in the others
- The goal is to identify and modify unhelpful patterns in this cycle

### 2. Cognitive Distortions

Common patterns of biased thinking that can lead to negative emotions:

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**

   - Seeing things in black and white categories
   - Example: "If I'm not perfect, I'm a failure"

2. **Overgeneralization**

   - Drawing broad conclusions from single events
   - Example: "I failed once, so I'll always fail"

3. **Mental Filter**

   - Focusing solely on negative aspects while filtering out positives
   - Example: Dwelling on one criticism while ignoring compliments

4. **Catastrophizing**

   - Assuming the worst possible outcome
   - Example: "If I make a mistake, my career will be ruined"

5. **Emotional Reasoning**
   - Believing something is true because it "feels" true
   - Example: "I feel incompetent, therefore I am incompetent"

### 3. Core Beliefs

- Fundamental beliefs about oneself, others, and the world
- Formed through early life experiences
