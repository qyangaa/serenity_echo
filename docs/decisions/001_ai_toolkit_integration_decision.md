# Decision Log: Flutter AI Toolkit Integration Exploration

## Context and Background

**Date**: [Current Date]
**Topic**: Evaluating Flutter AI Toolkit for CBT-structured chat implementation
**Decision Makers**: Development team

## Key Questions Explored

1. **Implementation Approach**

   - Question: Should we continue with custom OpenAI implementation or migrate to Flutter AI Toolkit?
   - Context: Need to implement CBT-structured chat experience with specific therapeutic requirements

2. **Feature Requirements**
   - Core requirements identified:
     - Session state management
     - Conversation control and guidance
     - Progress tracking and analysis
   - Additional features needed:
     - Message streaming
     - Voice input/output
     - Rich text formatting

## Investigation Process

### 1. Initial Requirements Analysis

- Reviewed current CBT implementation needs
- Documented in `cbt_resources/` directory:
  - CBT session structure
  - Therapeutic prompts
  - CBT fundamentals

### 2. Flutter AI Toolkit Evaluation

- Reviewed official documentation
- Key features analyzed:
  - Built-in chat UI components
  - Message routing capabilities
  - System instructions
  - Chat serialization
  - Custom response widgets

### 3. Implementation Effort Comparison

#### Custom Implementation (Current Approach)

- Pros:
  - Full control over implementation
  - Direct integration with OpenAI
  - Simpler architecture
- Cons:
  - Need to implement basic features
  - More maintenance required
  - Longer development time

#### Flutter AI Toolkit

- Pros:
  - Built-in chat features
  - Voice and rich text support
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Reduced implementation time
- Cons:
  - Less control over internal behavior
  - Need to adapt to toolkit constraints
  - Learning curve for team

## Decision Points

### 1. Initial Hesitation

- Concerns about maintaining CBT structure
- Questions about conversation control
- Uncertainty about toolkit flexibility

### 2. Turning Point

- Discovery of key toolkit features:
  - System instructions for CBT framework
  - Message routing for conversation control
  - Background analysis capabilities
  - Session management features

### 3. Final Considerations

- Implementation effort estimation:
  - Custom: 4-6 weeks
  - Toolkit: 2-3 weeks
- Feature comparison
- Maintenance considerations
- Future scalability

## Final Decision

**Decision**: Proceed with Flutter AI Toolkit integration

**Rationale**:

1. Significant time savings in implementation
2. Built-in support for required features
3. Robust foundation for therapeutic features
4. Better long-term maintainability

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Basic Setup**

   - Implement basic chat
   - Configure system instructions
   - Set up UI components

2. **Phase 2: Therapeutic Features**

   - Message routing
   - Session management
   - UI components

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**

   - Background analysis
   - Progress tracking
   - Voice features

4. **Phase 4: Polish**
   - UI/UX refinement
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling

## Resources Used

1. **Documentation**

   - [Flutter AI Toolkit Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/ai-toolkit)
   - Internal CBT resources
   - Architecture guidelines

2. **Code References**

   - Toolkit example implementations
   - Current OpenAI integration
   - CBT session structure

3. **Research Materials**
   - CBT implementation patterns
   - Chat application architectures
   - Therapeutic app design principles

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Session Structure**

   - Risk: Maintaining CBT phases
   - Mitigation: Combine system instructions with message routing

2. **Conversation Control**

   - Risk: Keeping therapeutic focus
   - Mitigation: Implement custom message routing

3. **Progress Tracking**
   - Risk: Complex analysis requirements
   - Mitigation: Use background processing

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed implementation plan
2. Set up toolkit integration
3. Begin phased implementation
4. Regular review and adjustment
